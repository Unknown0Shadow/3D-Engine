# 3D-Engine
3D Game Engine (Prototype)

I wanted to make a game where I can program npcs on the go and add them to interact with the environment and other npcs. Well, I'm way too far away from that, but I guess I have to start somewhere :) + I wanted the terrain to be something like Darwinia.

Keys:
Q add point (4 to create a visible shape | creating invisible dots / lines can occur though)
R remove last added shape
D delete the shape from current location (Not 100% precise. If doesn't work, try doing it on the corners.)
Numpad:
7 Up
9 Down
8 Forward
5 Backward
4 Left
6 Right
