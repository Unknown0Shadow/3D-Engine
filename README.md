# 3D-Engine
3D Game Engine (Prototype)

I wanted to make a game where I can program npcs on the go and add them to interact with the environment and other npcs. Well, I'm way too far away from that, but I guess I have to start somewhere :) + I wanted the terrain to be something like Darwinia.

Keys:<br>
Q add point (4 to create a visible shape | creating invisible dots / lines can occur though)<br>
R remove last added shape<br>
D delete the shape from current location (Not 100% precise. If doesn't work, try doing it on the corners.)<br>
Numpad:<br>
7 Up<br>
9 Down<br>
8 Forward<br>
5 Backward<br>
4 Left<br>
6 Right
